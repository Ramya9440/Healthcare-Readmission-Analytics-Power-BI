# Healthcare-Readmission-Analytics-Power-BI
End-to-end healthcare analytics project analyzing readmissions, cost drivers, and length of stay using SQL, Python, and Power BI.
Project Summary
This project delivers an end-to-end healthcare analytics solution designed to analyze hospital readmissions, cost drivers, and length of stay (LOS).
Using Power BI, SQL, and Python, the dashboard transforms raw healthcare visit data into actionable insights for hospital administrators and decision-makers.
The focus is on identifying high-risk patient cohorts, cost inefficiencies, and operational improvement opportunities.
🎯 Business Objectives

Monitor hospital readmission performance
Identify high-risk departments and patient segments
Analyze cost and length-of-stay drivers
Support data-driven operational decisions
Provide an interactive executive-level dashboard
❓ Key Business Questions Answered

Which departments have the highest readmission rates?

How do readmissions vary by age group?

What is the relationship between length of stay and treatment cost?

Which patient cohorts contribute most to high healthcare costs?

How do trends change over time?

📊 Key Metrics & KPIs

Total Admissions

Readmission Rate (%)

Readmission Count

Average Length of Stay (LOS)

Average Cost per Visit

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

DAX – KPI calculations and business metrics

SQL – Data validation, aggregations, cohort analysis

Python (Pandas) – Data exploration and preprocessing

CSV Dataset – Source data format

📈 Dashboard Features

Executive KPI cards for quick performance monitoring

Readmission rate analysis by department

Interactive slicers (Department, Age Group, Payor, Readmission Status)

Cohort analysis by Department × Age Group

Cost and length-of-stay comparison across patient segments

Trend analysis to support operational planning

🧠 Key Insights

Certain departments (e.g., Oncology and Cardiology) show higher readmission risk

Older age groups generally have longer LOS and higher treatment costs

Specific payor types contribute disproportionately to total healthcare costs

Cohort analysis helps identify high-risk, high-cost patient segments

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset represents synthetic healthcare visit data, including:

Admission and discharge dates

Department and payor information

Patient age groups

Cost and length of stay

30-day readmission indicator

The dataset is anonymized and used strictly for analytics demonstration purposes.

🚀 Business Value

This dashboard enables healthcare stakeholders to:

Track and reduce avoidable readmissions

Identify cost optimization opportunities

Improve patient care outcomes

Make informed, data-driven operational decisions
